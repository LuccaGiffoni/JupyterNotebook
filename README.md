# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem - Submission
## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to create a Jupyter Notebook named `DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb`, share it via GitHub, and include relevant documentation for each step. The notebook covers various aspects of the data science ecosystem, including languages, libraries, tools, and practical examples of arithmetic expressions in Python.

## Submission Steps

### Exercise 1: Create a Jupyter Notebook
- **File:** `DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb`

### Exercises 2-11: Markdown Cells and Code Cells
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to create markdown cells with titles, introductions, lists, tables, and code cells with arithmetic expressions.
- Take screenshots of each markdown and code cell output as instructed, naming them accordingly.

### Exercise 12: Share Notebook through GitHub
- Upload the completed notebook to a public repository on GitHub.
- Keep the GitHub repo link handy for submission.

### Exercise 13: Capture First Page Screenshot
- Take a screenshot of the first page of the notebook and save it as `1-notebook.png`.

## Final Note
This was my very first time working with Jupyter Notebooks and was very useful for my purposes and career!
